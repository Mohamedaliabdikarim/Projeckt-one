        <h1>Intersting facts about the moon</h1>
        <h4>1. The Moon is Earth's only permanent natural satellite</h4>
        <p>
          It is the fifth largest natural satellite in the Solar System, and the
          largest among planetary satellites relative to the size of the planet
          that it orbits.
        </p>
        <h4>2. The Moon is the second densest satellite</h4>
        <p>
          Among those whose densities are known anyway. The first densest is
          Jupiter's satellite Io.
        </p>
        <h4>3. The Moon always shows Earth the same face</h4>

        <p>
          The Moon is in synchronous rotation with Earth. Its near side is
          marked by large dark plains (volcanic ‘maria’) that fill the spaces
          between the bright ancient crustal highlands and the prominent impact
          craters
        </p>
        <h4>4. The Moon’s surface is actually dark</h4>
        <p>
          Although compared to the night sky it appears very bright, with a
          reflectance just slightly higher than that of worn asphalt. Its
          gravitational influence produces the ocean tides, body tides, and the
          slight lengthening of the day.​

        <h1>Did you know?</h1>
        <h4>5. The Sun and the Moon are not the same size</h4>
        <p>
          From Earth, both the Sun and the Moon look about same size. In fact
          the Moon is 400 times smaller than the Sun, but also 400 times closer
          to Earth.
        </p>
        <h4>6. The Moon is drifting away from the Earth</h4>
        <p>
          The Moon is moving approximately 3.8 cm away from our planet every year.
        </p>
        <h4>7. The Moon was made when a rock smashed into Earth</h4>
        <p>
          The most widely-accepted explanation is that the Moon was created when a rock the size of Mars slammed into Earth, shortly after the solar system began forming about 4.5 billion years ago.
        </p>
        <h4>8. The Moon makes the Earth move as well as the tides</h4>
        <p>
          Everyone knows that the Moon is partly responsible for causing the tides of our oceans and seas on Earth, with the Sun also having an effect.

          However, as the Moon orbits the Earth it also causes a tide of rock to rise and fall in the same way as it does with the water. The effect is not as dramatic as with the oceans, but nevertheless it is a measurable effect, with the solid surface of the Earth moving by several centimetres with each tide.
